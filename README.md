This code is designed to process Herschel PACS and SPIRE fluxes (expressed in cgs units), applying a modified blackbody function on a per-pixel basis. It facilitates the generation of Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) plots, as well as maps showing the final dust temperature and optical depth at 160 microns. The map dimensions are derived from the reference FITS file header.

The dust temperature and optical depth map at 160 micron are shown below (Kavak et al. in prep).
